- Tornar o modal funcional (colocar datetime em data.scheduled)
- Make ReadMoreJs more reliabe (sometimes it doesn't show up after changing tabs)
- Implement searching
- Implement keyword-notifying
- Implement news-notifying
- Far future: include SIPAC

- Make pull requests to ionic-timepicker because:
  - You chained increaseMinutes and increaseHours
  - You chained decreaseMinutes and decreaseHours
  - Standard blablabla doesn't work
  - When 'Set', etime didn't update the inputObj, the one directly accesible via bindings [fixed]
